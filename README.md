# 100-python-exercises-challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the 100+ python exercises challenge, proposed initially by [zhiwehu](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises) as a practice of python 2, and then collected and modified to python 3 solutions by [darkprinx](https://github.com/darkprinx/break-the-ice-with-python), who also added more problems. There are specifically 103 exercises distributed in 24 days. This is an amazing challenge to start getting used to this programming language, which includes problems of all levels, from beginners to advanced. 

This repository contains eight ipynb files:

1. "a. day 1-3.ipynb" - All questions and my solutions for problems from 1 to 13.
